This Nuxt project displays product and favorite lists across two pages. Product data is fetched from the dummyjson.com API. Clicking on a product opens a modal where users can add it to their favorites. The project is designed to showcase a list of products and allow users to manage their favorite products. The Product List page displays the initial product data, while the Favorites page displays the user's chosen products. The key feature is the modal that appears when a user clicks on a product. This modal provides details about the selected product and a way to add it to the user's favorites. The Favorites page then dynamically updates to reflect any additions.
